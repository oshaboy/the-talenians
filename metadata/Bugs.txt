cursor is visible
sensitivity is really high
if you move your cursor below the charecter instead of stopping to move it flips
needs a drop shadow
running into the mountain and is bumpy, after a while you submerge into it and then launch to space.
jumping should be acceleration (mario 64 gives the charecter a speed of 30 units per second and then makes him lose 4 units a second)
moving left and right a lot on a slope makes you fall through it
moving diagonaly is faster then straight?
moving sidewards is faster then straight?
^ might be the fact that after you land you keep the airspeed and as such move slower, also the sidewards air speed is faster
spamming spacebar up the mountain is just all kinda of weird
